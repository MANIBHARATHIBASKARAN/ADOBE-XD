### Goludoll Manufacturing Product App (Adobe XD Project)

#### Project Overview
This project showcases the design of a **mobile app** for Goludoll Manufacturing, created using **Adobe XD**. The app is designed to display various doll products, similar to popular e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.

#### Features Designed:

1. **Doll Photo**:  
   Each product page prominently features a high-quality photo of the doll.

2. **Doll Name**:  
   The name of each doll is displayed below the photo, making it easy for users to identify products.

3. **Details About the Doll**:  
   I provided essential details for each doll, such as material, size, and other product-specific information.

4. **Price of the Doll**:  
   The price of the doll is clearly displayed, allowing users to make purchasing decisions quickly.

#### Design Tools Used:
- **Adobe XD**: This tool was used to design the front page of the app, focusing on the layout, user interface, and overall visual presentation.

#### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my ability to design a clean, user-friendly **mobile app interface** for a product-based company. The design can easily be scaled and adapted for a full e-commerce platform.
